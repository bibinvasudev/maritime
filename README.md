        MCI mearsk container industry manufacturing WCD


Maersk has connected over 280,000 of its refrigerated containers to the AT&T network.
Each unit uses a remote container device (RCD) that has a 3G High Temperature SIM card, a GPS unit, a ZigBee radio and antenna, and multiple interfaces for connecting into the refrigerated container’s controller. 
The RCD can operate with two-way connectivity from just about anywhere in the world.

Here’s how it works. Each container has a monitoring device that collects data with sensors and sends it to a web portal.
Managers can view the location of containers for cargo owners. 
Back-office workers can easily find containers. 
Drivers have the tools to be more productive because they have more information about their next load to pick up.

A recent report by TMR projects the value of global digital transformation of the maritime freight market to reach ~US$ 38.4 billion by 2027. 
IoTNowTransport.com notes that – “The digital transformation of maritime freight has drastically improved the efficiencies of marine freight companies by enabling the integration of artificial intelligence technologies, blockchain, Internet of Things, and robotics with shipping models.”



Implementation of a dedicated wireless network at sea ports can be used for digital transformation and to facilitate adoption of new digital technologies.
All sorts of applications can be deployed, from connecting port assets to monitoring harbour conditions, or connecting wireless surveillance to enabling self-driving vehicles.
One technology leading the way in implementing dedicated wireless networks is Private LTE. 
Industry leading supplier Qualcomm defines a Private LTE network as one tailored to serve a limited geographic area with optimized services using dedicated equipment.

The Private LTE Market size is set to exceed USD 11 billion by 2024; according to a new research report by Global Market Insights, Inc.


smart containers as a ‘game-changer’.

Maersk Line has over the past years equipped more than 270,000 refrigerated containers or ‘reefers’ with Remote Container Management (RCM).
This technology allows us to track in real time the exact position of the container, its temperature and humidity and potential off service.
We went live operationally in Q3 2015 but are already seeing potential for the wealth of data available. 
RCM enables greater visibility over cargo, and more importantly, a significant reduction in damaged cargo.



Maersk has just gone public on its decision to equip its fleet of over 260,000 refrigerated containers with machine-to-machine (M2M) technology that gives global real-time visibility into equipment location and status, and allows the carrier to remotely control temperature, humidity and other climate settings for perishable cargoes.

5. Satellite Internet access is Internet access provided through communications satellites. 
   Modern consumer grade satellite Internet service is typically provided to individual users through geostationary satellites that can offer relatively high data speeds,-
   with newer satellites using Ku band to achieve downstream data speeds up to 506 Mbit/s.


INPUT FROM MARITIME EXPERTS 
==========================

1. Now vessel crew used broadband internet facilities, watch televisions even make call
2. Some companies used Intellian broadband 
3. International maritime sattelite is very popular, they have started all these facilities initially


Inputs regarding the tracking and monitoring in all ships
===========================================

1. Manually sending - position, average speed etc at Noon once a day
2. LRIT - long range , its going to flagstate. ie india registered ships information goes to india
   So indian will get information about its ships.LRIT is a part of  ISPS - international maritim securitys 
3. AIS- automatic identification system. For all ships AIS is mandatory
   AIS - ships data are automatically transmiting - gps position, course made good(effective course), effective speed, Geo heading, other stattic information like MMSI number maritime mobile station identification number , ship name, navigational status ie some time anchored, sailing, moved, crew numbers, body part how much inside water,  etc and will transmit through the VHF range and its publically available.
   All AIS recevier will get the nearest ships details
   AIS equipment is always on. 
   From Mid ocean also its transmitting

  
4. This is the new syatem that Maersk and all developed recently using GIS, IOT etc
    For REFER container delivery air temperature, written air temperature, container malfunction details, alarm status
   contianr international number(alpha numberic number)(container is sealled customes and we cannot open this only in emergency),origin, destination, cargo type
, upnormal dry container details, refer contaoner bayplan -ie its position , wind speed, wind direction
sea water temperature, removed lashing dry container details  and other AIS information as well can be transmit to control room


5. For liner service 6 month schedule is fixed. SO no prediction is needed for scheduling as of now

Digital transformation in the ocean shipping industry includes the ongoing deployment of sensors and tracking devices on refrigerated and dry shipping containers around the world. 
This smart container technology adoption enables greater visibility and management of goods being transported around the world.
A simple example is the shipment of bananas around the world. Shipping bananas requires refrigeration and controlled levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide while in a shipping container in order not to ripen prior to reaching the retailer. 
Smart container technology enables this control, tracking and monitoring to be possible.

While refrigerated containers (reefers) are being moved around on land, they are connected via commercial public mobile operator networks such as those offered by AT&T, Rogers, or Vodafone.
Each container has a smart device on it that uses mobile data services (GSM or LTE technology) to connect to the network. 
Once connected, it can share and transfer data to a centralized location where container owners can review real-time information and make decisions. 
They are also able to share this information with their customers and clients.

While the smart containers are at sea, there is no public mobile network coverage.
Without network coverage, the smart containers cannot be monitored remotely until it reaches the shore and reconnects.
Maritime shipping routes can be up to 20+ days and the only way to ensure a refrigerated container is working while at sea is to manually check it.
Large vessels can carry up to 10,000 containers so individually checking each unit becomes challenging.

Star Solutions’ Smart Container Solution enables each vessel the ability to have a private mobile network where it can continue to monitor, track and control the refrigerated units remotely during an ocean sailing.
With this private mobile network enabled at sea, shipping companies can offer its customers access to its smart container solution while on land and at sea.

The below diagram highlights the stages of mobile network coverage for goods being transported by smart containers. In stages where it states Public, it refers to the smart container being connected via the public mobile network (eg. AT&T, Rogers, Vodafone).
Private refers to the instances where a private mobile network on the shipping vessel connects to the smart containers locally and then enables data to be available to centralized resources.

Challenges facing IoT on the open seas
By collaborating with Ericsson to transmit signals remotely via satellite, all of the reefer’s vital statistics – such as temperature, power supply and location – are sent to a private cloud server provided by AT&T.
Over the past five years, Rasmussen has orchestrated an incredibly challenging roll-out process of these IoT devices in reefers, admitting that it “hasn’t been simple at all”.
“One thing we did [at Maersk] was to identify and develop a device that can work and handle the pressure that our equipment goes through,” Rasmussen said.
“We can have boxes going from the hottest place in Latin America to the coldest north of Alaska, so we need batteries, hardware and devices that can perform under pressure,” she explained.
The RCM platform consists of three different components including: a GPS unit to track its position at any given time, a 3G SIM card designed to work at high temperatures, and a GSM antenna.
The hardest part, she said in conversation with Siliconrepublic.com, was actually integrating an entirely new IT interface with a secure back-end solution.
But is Maersk Line using RCM and IoT to their full potential? Rasmussen added that while they can now use the system to react to faults in one of 270,000 containers, the end goal is to use data analytics to catch faults before they happen.

Maersk uses Azure IOT platform .The innovation and flexibility of the Azure platform gave them  confidence that the IoT capabilities in Azure were the best choice for them. 

===================


Collecting sensor data is nothing new in maritime transport. 
However, the global ship-to-shore connectivity – enabled by safe and secure Internet connection – makes it possible to gather data from an expanding array of onboard sensors and digitally distribute it throughout your logistics network.
